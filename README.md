### About me
I am currently a fourth year student at UC Davis majoring in Applied Statistics with a focus on electives related to the subject of economics. My skills in programming includes R, Python, C, and a bit of MATLAB and SQL. Aside from statistics and economics, I'm also interested in classics. I'm not sure what I want to do in the future but hopefully it will be related to some fields of statistics or economics. Below are some of the projects and assignments I have done in the past for STA 141B stat data technologies class which I'm currently taking and some of my older projects that I've converted into Python format.
