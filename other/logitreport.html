<title><b>Relationship Between Gender and Height</b></title>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>	It is usually said and believed that men are taller than women. From what we see in society, this is usually the case. When humans are at the point before they develop, heights could be similar but as they grow up, adult males tend to grow more than adult females. Males tend to be taller than females because they undergo a late growth spurt and grow faster than females. Though adult males are generally taller than adult females, there are always a few rare exceptions. This makes people wonder sometimes, how rare can these exceptions be. </p>
